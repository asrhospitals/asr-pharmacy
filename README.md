# ASR Pharmacy Inventory Management

A modern inventory and billing management system for pharmacies, built with React, Vite, and Redux Toolkit. This app features robust authentication, role-based access, and persistent login across reloads for a seamless user experience.

## Features
- User authentication with role-based access (Admin, Manager, User)
- Persistent login (token and user info stored in localStorage)
- Inventory management: companies, items, HSN, racks, salts, stores, units, manufacturers
- Purchase and billing modules
- Responsive dashboard and sidebar navigation
- Customizable data tables and modals
- Error boundaries and loading states

## Authentication Persistence
- On login, the authentication token and user info are saved to `localStorage`.
- On app load, the app restores authentication state from `localStorage` before rendering protected content.
- On logout, all authentication data is cleared from both Redux and `localStorage`.
